# Error Handling Improvements in Unsiloed-chunker

This document outlines the error handling improvements implemented across the Unsiloed-chunker library, focusing on proper exception handling, graceful degradation, and better diagnostic capabilities.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Custom Exception Classes

We've implemented a comprehensive exception hierarchy in `Unsiloed.utils.exceptions` to provide better categorization and context for errors:

```python
UnsiloedError (base class)
├── DocumentProcessingError
│   ├── ExtractionError
│   │   ├── PDFExtractionError
│   │   ├── DocxExtractionError
│   │   └── PptxExtractionError
│   ├── ChunkingError
│   └── FileFormatError
├── CacheError
├── MemoryError
├── UnsupportedOperationError
└── DependencyError
```

This allows for more precise error handling and targeted recovery strategies.

### 2. Graceful Degradation

The library now gracefully degrades when errors occur, attempting multiple fallback approaches:

- If a preferred extraction method fails, it automatically tries alternative methods
- If an optimized algorithm encounters an error, it falls back to standard implementations
- If a cache operation fails, it continues with direct processing rather than aborting
- Memory usage is monitored, and processing adapts when approaching limits

### 3. Enhanced Error Context

Error messages now contain rich contextual information:

- File metadata (name, type, size when available)
- Processing stage where the error occurred
- Specific extraction method that failed
- Technical details for debugging
- Suggestions for resolution when possible

### 4. Module-Level Improvements

#### Document Cache

- Better error handling in `get()` and `set()` operations
- Proper validation of inputs
- Detailed logging for cache failures
- Proper type annotations for both file paths and file-like objects

#### DOCX Processing

- StringIO for more efficient string operations
- Improved error handling for different extraction methods
- Better cleanup of temporary files
- Fallback mechanisms when BeautifulSoup is not available

#### PDF Processing

- Better memory management during extraction
- Proper cleanup of resources in error cases
- Path validation and error handling
- Multiple extraction method fallbacks

#### Chunking Processors

- Error handling during chunking strategy application
- Fallback to simpler strategies when advanced ones fail
- Memory monitoring during processing
- Better caching integration

## Implementation Approach

1. We've maintained backward compatibility by conditionally using custom exceptions
2. Error handlers provide meaningful error messages for users
3. Detailed logging helps with troubleshooting while keeping the user interface clean
4. Critical operations have multiple fallback mechanisms
5. Proper resource cleanup in all error scenarios

## Benefits

These improvements deliver:

1. More reliable document processing
2. Better diagnostics when errors occur
3. Graceful handling of edge cases
4. Improved stability for large documents
5. Better user experience with meaningful error messages
