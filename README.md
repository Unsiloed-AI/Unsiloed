### Advanced Caching System

The framework implements a sophisticated caching system to improve performance and memory management:

#### Document Cache

- **Multi-Strategy Caching**: Uses both TTL (time-to-live) and LRU (least recently used) caching strategies
- **Intelligent Cache Selection**: Automatically selects the appropriate cache type based on document size and characteristics
- **Memory Efficiency**: Large documents are stored in LRU cache to optimize memory usage
- **Automatic Expiration**: TTL cache automatically expires entries after configurable time period
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in statistics for cache hits, misses, and entry lifetimes
- **Smart Hashing**: Optimized hash generation for large files using metadata instead of full content hashing
- **Consistent Implementation**: Unified caching approach across all document types (PDF, DOCX, PPTX)
- **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with proper exception handling when cache operations fail
- **Performance Improvement**: Up to 99.9% faster processing for previously seen documents

#### Document Cache Performance

Our benchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvements when processing the same document multiple times:

| Document Type | Chunking Strategy | First Run | Cached Run | Improvement |
| ------------- | ----------------- | --------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| PDF           | Paragraph         | 302.59 ms | 0.19 ms    | 99.94%      |
| PDF           | Fixed Size        | 173.31 ms | 0.29 ms    | 99.83%      |
| DOCX          | Paragraph         | 26.60 ms  | 0.18 ms    | 99.32%      |
| DOCX          | Heading           | 15.15 ms  | 0.11 ms    | 99.27%      |
| PPTX          | Paragraph         | 167.88 ms | 15.79 ms   | 90.59%      |

This dramatic performance improvement is particularly valuable for:

- Interactive applications with repeated document access
- API-based services with high throughput requirements
- Batch processing workflows with document reuse

#### API Request Cache

- **Deduplication**: Prevents redundant API calls with identical parameters
- **Time-Based Expiration**: Configurable TTL for cached responses
- **Batch Processing**: Optimizes multiple API requests to reduce latency
- **Resilience**: Gracefully handles API rate limits and service disruptions
- **Memory Management**: LRU policy to evict least used entries when cache is full

For very large processing workloads, the caching system can reduce processing times by up to 90% for repeated operations.

#### Cache Migration Tool

For users upgrading from a previous version of the framework, we provide a cache migration tool to seamlessly transfer existing cached documents to the new multi-strategy caching system:

```bash
# Migrate from an old JSON cache
python tests/test_scripts/migrate_document_cache.py --old-cache path/to/old_cache.json

# Migrate from a pickle cache
python tests/test_scripts/migrate_document_cache.py --old-cache path/to/old_cache.pickle

# Verify migration success
python tests/test_scripts/migrate_document_cache.py --old-cache path/to/old_cache.json --verify
```

The migration tool automatically:

- Analyzes each cache entry to determine the optimal cache strategy (TTL or LRU)
- Preserves all document processing results while optimizing memory usage
- Generates statistics about migrated entries to verify success
